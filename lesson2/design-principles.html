            <p>This website does a really good job of limiting how much information is being put on the screen and does a good job of placing important information in their respective places. The menu is in the top right, the name of the buisness is in the top left, and the most important info in the middle of the screen.</p>

            <p>This website does a really good job of making sure that everything is aligned and that the images and that the text is not too far over or too close to other aspects of the website. It does a really good job of making sure it looks well aligned and that it stays uniform and clean.</p>

            <p>Squarespace does a really good job of making sure that their is appropriate white space between not only their text but also their images and boxes. They do a really good job of making sure that there is spacing between their images and that they do not feel very compact or close to the edges. Thier text also looks really good and is not too close each other.</p>
